# Overview #
## Final Grade - 80% ##
This is the final project for my Computer Science degree. It is a mood tracking application that focuses on helping users with Anxiety, it gives them facilities to track their moods and worries so that they can reflect upon them, as well as giving the opportunity to link their account with a therapist who can see their data and base their treatment off of that. 

It was the largest project I had undertaken at this point and a lot was learned about managing a larger code base and overall management of a project this size.

You can see the full report for this project within the repository, though a more convenient download link is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XzvTPAdZgmi9E-DITTnse32jiemtah7g/view?usp=sharing).

A video of the application can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5i7_beSd98&feature=youtu.be) and the poster for it is available here:
