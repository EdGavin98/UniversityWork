This project was undertaken for a web applications module. It is a Match Statistics viewer for the Game Dota 2, similar to Dotabuff and Opendota (formerly Yasp). The application was built using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular2 and Node.js) stack and was my first time using all of these technologies.

The report for this project can be seen within the repository.
